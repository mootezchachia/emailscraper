# emailscraper
Here is an example of a Python script that can be used to scrape email addresses from a website, save them to a text file, and then send the text file as an attachment to your email.
This script uses the requests and BeautifulSoup libraries to scrape the HTML content of a website and extract email addresses from the href attributes of a elements. It then saves the email addresses to a text file using the write() method of the open() function. Finally, it uses the smtplib library to send an email with the text file attached.

You will need to modify this script to suit your specific needs, such as changing the URL to scrape, the criteria for finding email addresses, and your email address and password. You may also want to customize the subject and recipient of the email.
